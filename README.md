# Image-colour-palette-Generator
extract the color name and how many percentage usage on that particular image


I developed an image color palette generator using Python, Flask, and Pandas, as well as a number of other libraries. The program allows users to upload an image file and generates a color palette of the dominant colors in the image. The program uses Flask to handle the server-side processing and Pandas to analyze the image and extract the dominant colors. The program also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using HTML and JavaScript, which displays the generated palette. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a full-stack web application using modern technologies and good coding practices.
